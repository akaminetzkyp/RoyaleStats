# RoyaleStats
The purpose of this project is to easily log a Clash Royale clan's information.

The following values of every player can be saved:
* Current weekly donations
* Last clan chest crowns

To log the clan's information the `main.py` file needs to be run. Reddit 
Tau's clan ID is set by default, but this string should be changed to the 
desired clan's ID.

Please create an issue if you have any doubt, problem, suggestion or comment.

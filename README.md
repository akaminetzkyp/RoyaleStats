# RoyaleStats
The purpose of this project is to easily log a Clash Royale clan's information.

The following values of every player can be saved:
* Current weekly donations
* Last clan chest crowns

To log the clan's information the `main.py` file needs to be run from the 
command line in the following way: `python3 main.py clan_id`. 

The time in the "Datetime" row is UTC.

Please create an issue if you have any doubt, problem, suggestion or comment.
